README
Our assignment was to combine multiple datasets generated by a study of various measurements of physical activity recorded on smartphones of 30 test subject. 
This is a machine learning dataset, in which a portion of the sample is used to “train” a set of algorithms and another, separate sample is used to “test” the initial analysis. 
We were asked to find the statistical mean of these measurements. The project was also designed to test our understanding of “tidy” data and how to implement these conventions on a large, fragmented data set.
Our specific instructions were to:
* Create a script to collect, assemble, merge, filter, re-label these data sets and then and write the results to a file called tidy_data.txt
* Produce a Code Book that recorded the changes we made to the original dataset, including measurements chosen or discarded, new labels, additional analysis, etc.
* Write a README (this file) explaining our work.
* Upload these components of our project to a GitHub repository
* Certify that the work is our own
