The original data set was filt3ered to include only mean and standard deviation values for each measurement
A complete crosswalk table is beyond the scope of the assignment. We have “tidied up” the column names by converting “t” to “time” and F to “freq”, “std” to “Std Dev”, etc.
The final analysis calculated the average (mean) value for each measurement for each subject.
The units in the final analysis were unchanged.
